# AniDB user scripts by Soulweaver

This repository consolidates the various user scripts I've written for [AniDB](https://anidb.net/) over the past
few years.

# How to use

First, install the relevant Greasemonkey compatible user script add-on for your browser
([Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) itself for Firefox,
[the Greasemonkey fork](https://github.com/janekptacijarabaci/greasemonkey/releases) for [Pale Moon](https://www.palemoon.org/),
or [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)
for most other browsers). After that, you can install a script in here by clicking its name, then clicking
"Raw" on the right. The add-on manager should then prompt you to verify you want to install the script and provide a
way to review the code to be sure of its authenticity. Once a script is installed, you don't need to do anything else
yourself â€“ the script will run on the page it is designed for and do its thing automatically.

**Greasemonkey 4 is not supported for now; maybe in the future. ([#10](https://github.com/soulweaver91/anidb-user-scripts/issues/10))**

# Commit tag legend

Since this repository will contain several autonomous scripts, most commits will only involve one of the scripts at
a time. To aid locating commits that involve a specific script, the following tags will be used for each of them
respectively:

| Tag             | Script                                                                |
| :---            | :---                                                                  |
